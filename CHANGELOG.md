# ChangeLog

## 2026-04-29

### Feature:

* Refactored the Web Config interface:
  * Introduced support for fine-grained configuration controls 
  * Added a basic online chat module.

* Added support for the following third-party development boards:
  * `m5stack_cores3` (PR #5, contributed by @imliubo)
  * `m5stack_sticks3` (PR #6, contributed by @imliubo)
  * `dfrobot_k10` (PR #28, contributed by @wxzed)
  * `lilygo_t_display_s3` (PR #14, contributed by @terry-cook)

* Enhanced CI board builds to support optional brand-specific board paths, emit `board_brand` in merged binary metadata, and append ESP32-P4 revision suffixes to generated merged binary artifacts while recording `rev` in the output JSON.

* Increased the Claw capability tool result buffer to 32 KB so larger tool responses can be returned. Updated `cap_files` file reads to reject oversized files before reading and return an explicit error when the file exceeds the max read limit.
  
* Increased Claw memory session message buffers to 4096 chars.
  
* Raised the Edge Agent tool iteration limit to 32 for longer multi-step interactions.

* Updated Claw memory Session History collection to size its JSON buffer from retained session records instead of worst-case configuration limits, reducing unnecessary heap usage for short histories.

* Added the `edge_agent` demo application with Wi-Fi setup, HTTP management UI, FATFS image content, Lua script examples, skill assets, router rules, scheduler rules, and partition defaults.

* Added shared application components for Claw capability wiring, CLI support, Lua module registration, captive DNS, display arbitration, emote rendering, settings storage, and Wi-Fi management.

* Added Edge Agent web APIs and frontend pages for configuration, status, file access, capabilities, Lua modules, and WeChat integration.

* Added I2C Lua module: Introduced support for hardware I2C bus initialization, device scanning, and standard register read/write operations.

* Added UART Lua module: Introduced UART port open/close, polling-based read/write and line reads, with a basic demo script.

* Added ADC Lua module: Introduced ADC channel creation, reading, and closing operations, with a basic demo script.

* Added file copy and move operations to `cap_files`, including automatic parent directory creation and rename fallback when direct moves are not available.

* Reworked `cap_time` to use SNTP-based synchronization, added on-demand current time retrieval, and injected a time context provider for relative date reasoning in `claw_core`.

### Change:

* Migrated selected Basic Demo updates into Edge Agent, including app configuration handling, HTTP UI updates, Lua module wiring, and default SDK configuration changes.

* Moved `dfrobot_k10` and other shipped board definitions into vendor-specific subdirectories, and relocated the LilyGO T-Display-S3 board assets from `basic_demo` to `edge_agent`.

### Fix:

* Cleared context outputs before collection across Lua jobs, tool catalogs, memory providers, and skill prompts so failed collection paths do not leak stale content.

* Fixed LilyGO T-Display-S3 LCD startup behavior.

### Refactor:

* Simplified skill activation and deactivation inputs from single `skill_id` to batch-oriented `skill_ids`, and added `all=true` support for clearing active skills.
* Updated skill manager results to echo requested skills and keep session-visible capability groups in sync after batch operations.
* Updated the display skill guidance.

### Feature:

* Synced builtin Lua scripts from component `lua_scripts` directories into `basic_demo`, replacing the old scattered `fatfs_image/scripts/builtin` layout.
* Added `sync_component_lua_scripts.py` and extended CMake sync flow so builtin scripts and generated manifests can be maintained automatically.
* Added router example scripts for LLM analyze and message/file publishing, then removed the send-message and send-file examples to narrow the shipped set.

### Fix:

* Preserved reasoning content in tool-call history across `claw_core` and OpenAI-compatible LLM backend flows.
* Updated `cap_lua` skill docs to prefer reusing existing scripts before creating new ones.
* Refined capability skill documentation and tightened `cap_router_mgr` guidance to reduce ambiguous tool usage.

### Refactor:

* Simplified `cap_lua` argument handling so `lua_run_script` and `lua_run_script_async` only forward explicit `args` payloads instead of auto-merging agent session context.
* Simplified `event_publisher.publish_message` to require a table input with explicit `source_cap`, `channel`, `chat_id`, and `text` fields.
* Removed runtime `taskYIELD` behavior from the Lua timeout hook and relaxed the hook cadence to run every 1000 instructions.
* Normalized JSON number handling in Lua runtime to always push numbers as Lua numbers instead of preserving integer form.
